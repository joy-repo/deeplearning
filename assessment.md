Excellent — here’s a more professional, metrics-ready version of your self-assessment, written in the tone and structure typically expected at JPMC.
I’ve added placeholders for measurable data (e.g., number of pipelines, tickets, timelines) — you can easily fill those in later.

Would you like me to also add a short “Manager Summary / Self-Reflection” paragraph (something like a closing note expressing gratitude and growth mindset)? It often strengthens the tone of the self-assessment.
